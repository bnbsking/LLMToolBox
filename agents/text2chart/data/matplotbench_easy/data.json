The first line should represent the square of a numerical sequence ranging from 0.0 to 3.0 in increments of 0.02. The second line should represent the cosine of '3*pi' times the same sequence. The third line should represent the product of the square of the sequence and the cosine of '3*pi' times the sequence.\n\n2. The plot should have a legend, labeling the first line as 'square', second line as 'oscillatory' and the third line as 'damped'.\n\n3. The x-axis should be labeled as 'time' and the y-axis as 'amplitude'. The title of the plot should be 'Damped oscillation'.\n\nCould you help me with this?\"",
